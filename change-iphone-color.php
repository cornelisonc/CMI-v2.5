			<p>Accidents happen. Screens get cracked. For those who want to turn a bad situation into a great one, we offer a way to change iPhone color which will repair you broken front and back glass as well as your home button and LCD screen!</p>

			<p>We offer a wide variety of colors to choose from, including red, yellow, blue, green, purple, pink, orange, baby blue, zebra, and camo. New colors and designs are being added regularly. Watch for pink leopard print and Hello Kitty designs this summer!</p>

			<p>These colors are not simply a sticker or case--they are painted on the underneath side of the glass--just like a black or white iPhone. Your iPhone will look and work exactly the same, but will sport a new flashy color of your choice!</p>

			<p>We offer options to “do it yourself,” which includes all necessary parts and tools, or “send in for service,” where our professional service technicians will be sure its done right. We use only the best parts, and our technicians have fixed hundreds of iPhones. If you want to change iPhone color, you've come to the right place!</p>
