			<p>We offer the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S in a variety of colors, but here at color-my-i, our favorite iPhone color is pink! It really stands out and looks simply amazing! That's probably why it's our best selling color. If you already have an iPhone, consider sending it in for our 24 hour color swap service.</p>

			<p>Want your pink iPhone to really stand out? Try it with a white or black home button at no extra charge. A little contrast can go a long way.</p>

			<p>Our color iPhones make great gifts! You can be sure that your wife, girlfriend, or daughter will love her new pink iPhone...and all of her friends will be super jealous!</p>

			<p>As always, if you have any questions about our products or services, don't hesitate to contact us.</p>
